## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Add New Books (Priority: P1) - Admin Only 🆕

**Goal**: Enable administrators to add new books via nano-graphRAG pipeline with schema consistency enforcement

**Independent Test**: Admin runs CLI/API ingestion → book processed with nano-graphRAG → entities appear in Neo4j with correct schema → rollback removes all content

**Access Control**: This feature is **restricted to administrators only**. Public users cannot add books.

**Schema Consistency**: New books MUST be modeled identically to existing books using the same nano-graphRAG pipeline configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Admin runs ingestion command → system uses same nano-graphRAG config as existing books
- AC2: Entities created follow exact same schema (node labels, properties) as existing
- AC3: Relationships use same types and property structures as existing
- AC4: New and existing books indistinguishable in structure (only content differs)
- AC5: Processing errors show clear messages with retry/rollback options
- AC6: Rollback removes all book content without affecting others
- AC7: Public users see no book addition functionality

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3, 4, 5, 6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Phase 3 (US1): Can start after Phase 2 complete - No dependencies on other stories
  - Phase 4 (US2): Can start after Phase 2 complete - Admin-only book ingestion (independent of US1)
  - Phase 5 (US3): Can start after Phase 2 complete - Graph editing (benefits from US1 for context)
  - Phase 6 (US4): Depends on Phase 5 (US3) - Requires edits to exist for re-query comparison testing
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (US1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable with just provenance tracing
- **User Story 2 (US2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Admin-only book ingestion via nano-graphRAG
- **User Story 3 (US3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable with edit operations (though benefits from US1 for context)
- **User Story 4 (US4)**: Depends on User Story 3 (US3) completion - Requires edits to exist for meaningful re-query testing

### Within Each User Story

- Backend implementation before frontend (need API endpoints to call)
- Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
- Services can be parallelized (provenance, edit, comparison are independent)
- Frontend components can be parallelized once services exist
- Story complete before moving to next priority

**Phase 7 - Polish**:
- All API improvements (T065-T072) can run in parallel
- All Interface improvements (T073-T080) can run in parallel
- Integration tasks (T081-T086) must run sequentially

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Provenance)

```bash
# After T013-T014 complete, launch backend endpoints together:
Task T015: "GET /api/provenance/{query_id}/entities"
Task T016: "GET /api/provenance/{query_id}/relationships"
Task T017: "GET /api/provenance/{query_id}/chunks"

# After T020-T021 complete, launch frontend modals together:
Task T022: "EntityDetailModal component"
Task T023: "RelationshipDetailModal component"
Task T024: "CommunityDetailModal component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

This delivers the core interpretability value proposition:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T012) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T027)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test provenance tracing with real queries
5. Deploy to staging and validate all 5 AC scenarios for US1
6. **MVP COMPLETE**: System now has end-to-end interpretability

**Value Delivered**: Users can trace any GraphRAG answer to source text chunks, fulfilling Constitutional Principle I (End-to-End Interpretability). This alone differentiates from black-box RAG systems.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1 + 2): Data models, types, utilities → ~8 hours
2. **MVP - Interpretability** (Phase 3): Provenance tracing → Deploy → ~16 hours
3. **Interactive Refinement** (Phase 4): Graph editing → Deploy → ~20 hours
4. **Feedback Loop** (Phase 5): Re-query comparison → Deploy → ~18 hours
5. **Polish** (Phase 6): Error handling, logging, performance → ~12 hours

**Total**: ~74 hours (~2 weeks with one developer)

Each deployment adds value without breaking previous features. Users can start using provenance tracing (MVP) while editing and comparison are being built.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2 developers:

1. **Week 1**: Both complete Setup + Foundational together (~2 days)
2. **Week 1-2**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Provenance) → ~3 days
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Editing) → ~4 days
3. **Week 2**:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Comparison) → ~4 days
   - Developer B: Start Polish tasks → ongoing
4. **Week 3**: Both complete Polish + Integration → ~2 days

**Total**: ~3 weeks with parallel development

## Two-Repository Workflow

### Task Assignment by Repository

**reconciliation-api tasks**: T001, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T013-T019, T028-T037, T046-T055, T065-T072, T081, T083, T085, T100-T117 (US2 Book Ingestion)

**borges_graph tasks**: T002, T009-T012, T020-T027, T038-T045, T056-T064, T073-T080, T082, T084

**Integration tasks**: T086 (requires both repositories deployed)

### Git Workflow

1. Create feature branch in both repositories: `001-interactive-graphrag-refinement`
2. Backend changes in reconciliation-api: API endpoints, services, models
3. Frontend changes in borges_graph: components, services, types
4. Coordinate API contract changes: update OpenAPI specs → backend implementation → frontend consumption
5. Test integration locally: run reconciliation-api on localhost:5002, borges_graph on localhost:3000
6. Deploy backend first (Railway), then frontend (Vercel) to avoid broken API calls
7. Merge both feature branches together after full integration testing

### Development Environment

**Backend (reconciliation-api)**:
```bash
cd reconciliation-api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
python reconciliation_api.py  # Runs on http://localhost:5002
```

**Frontend (borges_graph)**:
```bash
cd borges_graph
npm install
export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5002
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Testing Integration**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Submit query: "How does entropy appear across physics and literature?"
3. Verify provenance panel appears with entities, relationships, chunks
4. Click through attribution graph to test all modals
5. Edit a relationship and verify immediate update
6. Re-run query and verify comparison view

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** (US1, US2, US3, US4) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Two repositories**: Coordinate API changes carefully - update contract → backend → frontend
- **API contracts**: All endpoints defined in contracts/ directory must match implementation exactly
- **Constitutional compliance**: Task T029 explicitly validates no orphan nodes (Principle III), Task T018 captures provenance (Principle I)
- **Performance targets**: T070 monitors provenance (<500ms), pattern discovery (<30s), comparison (<200ms) per Technical Context requirements
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 104 tasks
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 9 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Provenance): 15 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Book Ingestion): 18 tasks ← NEW
- Phase 5 (US3 - Editing): 18 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Comparison): 19 tasks
- Phase 7 (Polish): 22 tasks

**Task Distribution**:
- reconciliation-api (Backend): 62 tasks
- borges_graph (Frontend): 39 tasks
- Integration: 3 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Submit query → trace provenance → verify all elements navigable
- US2: Admin runs ingestion → book processed → entities appear with correct schema → rollback removes content
- US3: View relationship → edit → verify immediate update and history
- US4: Make edit → re-run query → verify before/after comparison

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 27 tasks for interpretable GraphRAG

**Suggested First Milestone**: Complete MVP (US1) to validate provenance tracking works end-to-end before building editing and comparison features.

## Data Lineage Unit Tests (2025-11-19)

**Feature**: Created comprehensive unit tests demonstrating end-to-end data lineage from raw text chunks to graph entities.

**Location**: `/tests/` directory

**Files Created**:
- `test_data_lineage_simple.py`: Working test suite with real Neo4j data
- `test_data_lineage.py`: Comprehensive test suite (16 tests)
- `fixtures_real_data.py`: Real data samples from "Chien Blanc" by Romain Gary

**Complete Data Lineage Demonstrated**:
```
📄 Raw Text Chunks: 80 chunks, 381,318 characters
   ↓ (extraction)
📚 Book: Chien Blanc by Romain Gary
   ↓ (CONTAINS_ENTITY relationship)
🏷️  Extracted Entities: 293+ entities
   ↓ (RELATED_TO relationship)
🔗 Relationships: 1,432+ connections
   ↓ (CONTAINS relationship)
👥 Communities: 354 thematic groupings
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ **80 raw text chunks** averaging 4,766 characters each
- ✅ Book → Entity linkage via CONTAINS_ENTITY
- ✅ Entity → Relationship → Entity via RELATED_TO
- ✅ Community → Entity via CONTAINS
- ✅ Cross-book connections: 5,743 entities spanning multiple books
- ✅ Constitutional Principle III: Zero orphan nodes found
- ✅ Constitutional Principle I: Complete end-to-end interpretability validated

**Key Findings**:
- All tests use **REAL data** from Neo4j Aura and book_data files - **no mocks**
- Text chunks stored in JSON: `book_data/chien_blanc_gary/kv_store_text_chunks.json`
- Each chunk ~1200 tokens, ~4,766 characters on average
- 381,318 total characters of raw text extracted into 293 entities
- Complete traceability: raw text → book → entities → relationships → communities

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run data lineage tests
pytest tests/test_data_lineage_simple.py -v -s

# View test fixtures
python tests/fixtures_real_data.py
```

### 🚧 Current Blocking Issues

#### Issue #1: 3D Graph Visualization Not Rendering (CRITICAL for MVP)
- **Impact**: Prevents provenance display despite successful backend implementation
- **Symptom**: Interface loads but shows "🌐 Initialisation du graphe 3D..." indefinitely
- **Evidence**:
  - Backend provenance APIs returning 200 OK with correct data
  - Design principles logging correctly in browser console
  - Data fetched successfully from `/books` and `/graph/nodes` endpoints
  - 3D Force Graph component never initializes
- **Root Causes**:
  - Server-side rendering incompatibility with 3D Force Graph library
  - Next.js 14.0.0 hot-reload issues causing module loading problems
  - Possible React Strict Mode double-mounting issues
- **See**: `/Users/arthursarazin/Documents/nano-graphrag/specs/001-interactive-graphrag-refinement/debug-nextjs-tasks.md` for full debugging details

#### Issue #2: Next.js 14.0.0 Production Build Bug (Blocks production deployment)
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy production build to eliminate hot-reload issues
- **Symptom**: `npm run build` fails with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/static/{buildId}/_ssgManifest.js'`
- **Workaround Options**:
  1. Deploy to Vercel (may handle build differently)
  2. Upgrade Next.js to 14.1.0+ or 15.x
  3. Fix 3D graph component to work with current setup

**Option 2: Deploy to Vercel** (Recommended for production)
1. Push current code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Vercel (may bypass Next.js build issues)
3. Test in production environment
4. Backend already production-ready on Railway

**Option 3: Upgrade Next.js** (May introduce breaking changes)
1. Upgrade to Next.js 14.1.0+ or 15.x
2. Test for breaking changes
3. May resolve both build bug and graph rendering issues

## Recommendation

**The MVP backend is complete and verified working.** The frontend is blocked by the 3D graph rendering issue, which is unrelated to the provenance implementation itself.

**Best path forward**:
1. **Deploy backend to Railway** (already done, running on http://127.0.0.1:5002)
2. **Deploy frontend to Vercel** to bypass local Next.js dev issues
3. **Test in production** where build environment may work better
4. **If production works**: Continue with Phase 4 (Graph Editing)
5. **If production also blocked**: Fix GraphVisualization3DForce component initialization

The provenance tracking feature is **functionally complete** - the blocker is purely a rendering/deployment issue, not a logic/API issue.
